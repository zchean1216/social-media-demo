        <ul class="about-list">
            <li><strong>Tasks not attempted or completed:</strong> 
                I successfully completed all tasks, including extra challenges like <span class="highlight">pagination</span> and <span class="highlight">mutual friend count</span>.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Special features implemented:</strong> 
                I implemented features such as <span class="highlight">mutual friend count</span>, an <span class="highlight">animated greeting message</span> to make the interface more engaging and interactive, and <span class="highlight">pagination</span> for easier navigation. Additionally, I added a feature for users to <span class="highlight">update their own status message</span>, which is a popular trend on social media platforms today. I considered adding a friend request approval feature but I personally think it is better to stay within the assignment's guidelines, which focused on a <span class="highlight">one-way relationship system</span>.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Parts I had trouble with:</strong> 
                I initially struggled with handling the <span class="highlight">one-way friendship logic</span> and calculating <span class="highlight">mutual friends</span>, but I was able to overcome these challenges through careful debugging and problem-solving.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>What I would like to improve:</strong> 
                In the future, I would like to <span class="highlight">optimize my code</span> further and improve the <span class="highlight">styling consistency</span> across the site. I would also love to implement a <span class="highlight">complete friend request system</span>, allow users to <span class="highlight">upload profile pictures</span>, and add a <span class="highlight">notification system</span> for a more interactive experience. It would be even better if I could create an interface that allows users to <span class="highlight">post updates</span> on their activity feed and <span class="highlight">share</span> them with their friends.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Additional features added:</strong> 
                I included <span class="highlight">user-friendly animations</span>, interactive UI elements, and the <span class="highlight">status update feature</span> to make the platform more dynamic and enjoyable for users. The <span class="highlight">reason</span> I chose to implement this feature is that it adds a <span class="highlight">more personalized</span> experience for the user, allowing them to share their current thoughts or activities. I've also added user-friendly navigation by providing <span class="highlight">relative links</span> on both the <span class="highlight">sign-up</span> and <span class="highlight">login</span> pages. This ensures a smoother experience for users. For instance, if a user is on the <span class="highlight">sign-up</span> page but realizes they already have an account, they can quickly navigate to the <span class="highlight">login</span> page using the provided link. Similarly, if they are on the <span class="highlight">login</span> page but don&rsquo;t have an account yet, they can easily switch to the <span class="highlight">sign-up</span> page. This feature enhances convenience by allowing users to move between the pages effortlessly, preventing any frustration caused by being on the wrong page.
